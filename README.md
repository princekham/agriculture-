## Controlling fruit flies
- To control fruit flies, Acetamiprid 20% SP is known to be effective. It is a key pesticide in commercial cherry farming due to its effectiveness against the larvae of the cherry fruit fly
- The combination of Difenoconazole- 12.5% and Azoxystrobin - 20.0% is primarily used for the management of fungal diseases in crops and does not specifically target fruit flies
- Lambda-cyhalothrin, a synthetic pyrethroid, is also effective against a number of insect pests, including fruit flies. It can be applied as a topsoil drench beneath host/target trees within a quarantine zone to target emerging larvae
